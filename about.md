I'm an engineer at Uber Advanced Technologies Group in Pittsburgh, where we work on self driving technology. I'm a deep believer in the potential of technology to move us forward, specifically its potential as an equalizer and to improve the quality of our lives.

I'm interested in machine learning and its applications to machine perception, language understanding, knowledge representation and robotics. I'm endlessly curious about the architectures, algorithms, systems and designs that are involved in bringing machine learning to the said areas.
